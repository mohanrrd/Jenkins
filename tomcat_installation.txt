Step 1: Verifying Java Installation
To verify Java installation, open the console and execute the following java command.
OS	Task	Command
Windows	Open command console	\>java –version
Linux	Open command terminal	$java –version
If Java has been installed properly on your system, then you should get one of the following outputs, depending on the platform you are working on.

OS	Output
Windows	 Java version "1.7.0_60"
Java (TM) SE Run Time Environment (build 1.7.0_60-b19)
Java Hotspot (TM) 64-bit Server VM (build 24.60-b09, mixed mode)

Linux	
openjdk version "1.8.0_65"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)



In case you do not have Java JDK, you can download it from the link Oracle

Step 2: Verifying Java Installation
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the base directory location where Java is installed on your machine. For example,

OS	Output
Windows	Set Environmental variable JAVA_HOME to C:\ProgramFiles\java\jdk1.7.0_60
Linux	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java-current
Append the full path of the Java compiler location to the System Path.

OS	Output
Windows	Append the String; C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_60\bin to the end of the system variable PATH.
Linux	export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin/
Verify the command java-version from command prompt as explained above.
